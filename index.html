        <h2>Why I created this page?</h2>
        <p>I have decided to start this page for two reasons.</p>

        <p>One: I am amazed by the progress in the makers movement and how easy it is to build things nowadays. 
        Also it is astounding how the software world is entering into traditional hardware like circuit breakers, 
        switchgear assemblies or power generation sets.It seems to me that the modern Electrical Engineers (EE's) 
        should be fluent in a programming language, which allows them solve complex engineering problems quicker.</p>

        <p>Two: I am fairly worried to hear news from universities in Poland that less and less students decide to 
        study electrical engineering. It gets me thinking how will I learn about new trends in science if not from 
        fresh graduates that come to work with me.</p> 

        <p>I hope that thanks to this page I will be able to show that electrical engineering can also be cool 
        and that at least some of people who will get a chance to read it will chose a career as an EE.</p>

          <h2>Python based projects</h2>
          <p>I have created a repository to share Jupyter notebooks with some examples of how to use Python (and I'm still 
          learning it) to solve for basic electrical engineering problems like transients in RL and RLC circuits. </p>

          <h2>Raspberry Pi based projects</h2>
          <p>Raspberry Pi comes with pre-installed Mathematica, which is also interesting tool to use in order to solve
          electrical engineering problems. I also do hope that in future I will be able to present the projects based on
          using Pi for practical applications.</p>
